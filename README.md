[Click here to search for your book.  It didn't work?  Must be something wrong on your end.  Try again.  Yesssss... just keep trying...](http://serene-journey-47947.herokuapp.com/).

## Description
GOOSE CD is an application disguised as a functional React Google Search application
* Unsuspecting users will spend countless hours wasting their time trying to search for books - but will never get results
* Hilarity ensues. You thought you could find your book SUCKAH!!!

## Motivation
Attempting to finish bootcamp homework

## Results
It's all about perspective.  One man's trash is another man's treasure, so out of the ashes of a failed attempt comes a new program, or at least a new perception thereof.  

## Team Efforts
* layout - ME
* coding - ME
* Gittin' the hub - ME
* Everything else - ME

### Challenges
Oh. My. God.  Anybody who can finish this homework is quite literally a mental titan in my eyes. To me, React is like trying to assemble a jigsaw puzzle in Rhode Island when all the pieces are scattered in the rest of the states.  And you have to do it blindfolded.  And there's no real guide.  And moving one piece takes 30 minutes.  

## Improvements
* I suppose making it function according to the original requirements would be an improvement.
* I have Heroku hooked up as a remote repo - but I'm blocked from uploading files for reasons that I can't figure out
* I'm supposed to hook up a Mongo database... but it seems pointless to do that because Heroku doesn't work. 
* I really wish there was a set of instructions on how to do this.  Stumbling around blindly hasn't been the best experience.
